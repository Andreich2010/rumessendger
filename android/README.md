# Android

The Gradle wrapper JAR is not tracked in version control. If it is missing, download it from the official Gradle distributions:

https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip

Extract `gradle-wrapper.jar` from the archive's `gradle/wrapper/` directory and place it at `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.

# Rumessendger Android Client

This directory contains a minimal Android client that connects to the ejabberd
server used by the project. It demonstrates basic chat functionality, stream
management with automatic reconnection, message archive retrieval (MAM) and
push notification registration (XEP‑0357) using the
[Smack](https://www.igniterealtime.org/projects/smack/) library. Encryption can
be switched between standard server‑side storage and client‑side OMEMO.

## Configuration

Update the XMPP connection details in
[`app/src/main/java/com/rumessendger/XmppConfig.kt`](app/src/main/java/com/rumessendger/XmppConfig.kt)
with your server domain, host and user credentials.

Push notification registration requires a device token (for example from FCM).
Invoke `XmppClient.registerPush(token)` once a token is available.

## Build

The Gradle wrapper JAR (`gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`) is excluded from
version control. Download it before running Gradle:

```bash
curl -o gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gradle/gradle/v8.4.0/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar
```

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

The first build downloads the Android Gradle plugin and Smack dependencies.

## Run

Install the generated APK from `app/build/outputs/apk/` onto an Android device
or emulator:

```bash
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
```

Once installed, the app connects to the configured server on startup and listens
for incoming messages.
