The Gradle wrapper JAR is not tracked in version control. If it is missing, download it from the official Gradle distributions:

https://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.5-bin.zip

Extract `gradle-wrapper.jar` from the archive's `gradle/wrapper/` directory and place it at `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`.
